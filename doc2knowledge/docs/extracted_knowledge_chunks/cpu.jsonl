{'name': 'cpu_resource_contention', 'content': 'This function checks whether there is contention for CPU resources by other processes outside the database. If the maximum CPU usage of these processes exceeds the threshold specified in the variable "cpu_usage_threshold", the function sets the "system_cpu_contention" key in the "detail" dictionary to indicate the current user CPU usage. If this key is set, the function suggests handling exception processes in the system as a solution. If the "system_cpu_contention" key is not set, this issue is not a root cause.'}

{'name': 'os_resource_contention', 'content': 'This function checks for a potential issue where other processes outside the database may be occupying too many handle resources. If the system file descriptor (fds) occupation rate exceeds the detection threshold, it is considered a root cause and the function returns a boolean value of True. The system fds occupation rate is recorded in the diagnosis report along with a suggestion to determine whether the handle resource is occupied by the database or other processes. If the system fds occupation rate is below the tuple_number_threshold, it is not a root cause and the function returns a boolean value of False.'}

{'name': 'CPU_analysis_and_diagnostics', 'content': 'The code provided is analyzing the CPU workload and providing diagnostics based on certain conditions. \n\nFirst, the code retrieves CPU information using the "getcpu" function. It initializes variables "sql_cpu", "flag_cpu", and "cpuinfo". \n\nThen, it enters a loop to process each CPU resource. It concatenates SQL queries using the values from each resource, which will be used for further analysis. \n\nThe code then checks the value of the "r" attribute in each resource. If it is less than or equal to the variable "cpun" (representing the number of CPU threads), it indicates that the CPU load is not high. However, if it is greater than "cpun" but less than or equal to "cpun" multiplied by 2, it suggests that the CPU load is relatively high. If the value of "r" exceeds "cpun" multiplied by 2, it indicates a high CPU load with potential risks. The variable "flag_cpu" is incremented accordingly to keep track of the CPU load status.\n\nThe code then examines the value of the "us" attribute (representing CPU usage). If it is less than 20, it suggests that the CPU usage is not high. If it is between 20 and 80 (inclusive), it indicates normal CPU usage. If it is between 80 and 95 (inclusive), it suggests relatively high CPU usage. If the value exceeds 95 and the "r" value is greater than "cpun" multiplied by 2, it indicates a high CPU usage with a potential bottleneck. Otherwise, it concludes that the CPU is currently not experiencing performance bottlenecks.\n\nNext, the code evaluates the value of the "sys" attribute (representing system CPU usage). If it is less than 15, it suggests normal system CPU usage. If it is between 15 and 30 (inclusive), it indicates relatively high usage and requires attention to potential system issues. If it exceeds 30, it suggests significantly high system CPU usage, indicating the presence of serious vulnerabilities.\n\nBy analyzing the CPU information and applying various conditions, the code provides diagnostic information in the variable "cpuinfo". The variable "flag_cpu" keeps track of the number of identified CPU load issues.'}
