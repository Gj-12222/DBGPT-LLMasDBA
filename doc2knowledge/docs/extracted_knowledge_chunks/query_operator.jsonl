{'name': 'poor_join_performance', 'content': "This code diagnoses poor performance in join operations. There are four main situations that can cause poor join performance: 1) when the GUC parameter 'enable_hashjoin' is set to 'off', which can result in the optimizer choosing NestLoop or other join operators even when HashJoin would be more suitable; 2) when the optimizer incorrectly chooses the NestLoop operator, even when 'set_hashjoin' is on; 3) when the join operation involves a large amount of data, which can lead to high execution costs; and 4) when the cost of the join operator is expensive. \n\nIn general, NestLoop is suitable when the inner table has a suitable index or when the tuple of the outer table is small (less than 10000), while HashJoin is suitable for tables with large amounts of data (more than 10000), although index will reduce HashJoin performance to a certain extent. Note that HashJoin requires high memory consumption.\n\nThe code checks for abnormal NestLoop, HashJoin, and MergeJoin operators, and identifies inappropriate join nodes based on the number of rows and cost rate. It also provides suggestions for optimization, such as setting 'enable_hashjoin' to 'on', optimizing SQL structure to reduce JOIN cost, and using temporary tables to filter data. \n\nIf the code finds any poor join performance, it is considered a root cause of the problem. Otherwise, it is not a root cause."}

{'name': 'complex_execution_plan', 'content': 'This is a function that checks for complex execution plans in SQL statements. The function identifies two cases that may cause complex execution plans: (1) a large number of join or group operations, and (2) a very complex execution plan based on its height. If the function identifies either of these cases, it sets the corresponding details and suggestions for the user. If the number of join operators exceeds the "complex_operator_threshold" or the plan height exceeds the "plan_height_threshold", the function considers it a root cause of the problem. Otherwise, it is not a root cause.'}

{'name': 'poor_aggregation_performance', 'content': "This function diagnoses poor aggregation performance in SQL queries. It identifies four potential root causes: (1) when the GUC parameter 'enable_hashagg' is set to 'off', resulting in a higher tendency to use the GroupAgg operator; (2) when the query includes scenarios like 'count(distinct col)', which makes HashAgg unavailable; (3) when the cost of the GroupAgg operator is expensive; and (4) when the cost of the HashAgg operator is expensive. The code checks for these conditions and provides detailed information and suggestions for each potential root cause. If none of these conditions are met, poor aggregation performance is not a root cause."}
