{'name': 'memory_resource_contention', 'content': 'This function checks whether there is contention for memory resources by other processes outside the database. If the maximum system memory usage exceeds the detection threshold specified in the variable "mem_usage_threshold", the function sets the "system_mem_contention" key in the "detail" dictionary to indicate that the current system memory usage is significant. If the "system_mem_contention" key exists in the "detail" dictionary, the function suggests checking for external processes that may be consuming resources. If the function returns True, it indicates that memory resource contention is a root cause of the problem. If the function returns False, it means that memory resource contention is not a root cause.'}

{'name': 'Memory_usage_analysis_diagnosis', 'content': 'The code lines are analyzing and diagnosing the memory usage of a system. The code first retrieves the memory information using the "getmem" function. Then, it fetches the long-term memory information using the "getltmem" function with specific parameters. \n\nNext, the code initializes variables to store information about memory and swap usage. There are also flag variables that indicate whether there are any memory or swap issues.\n\nThe code then constructs a SQL query to retrieve specific memory information for each record obtained from the "getmem" function. Based on the retrieved information, the code analyzes the memory usage and assigns appropriate diagnostic messages to the "mem_info" variable. \n\nIf the physical memory usage exceeds 90% and the free memory is below 200M and above 100M, it indicates that the physical memory usage is high and the available memory is low, which may pose performance risks. Similarly, if the physical memory usage exceeds 90% and the free memory is below 100M, it suggests a high memory usage and a significant performance risk.\n\nIf the physical memory usage exceeds 20% of the recent average, it is recommended to perform further checks. \n\nThe code also checks the swap usage. If the swap usage is above 50% and below 80%, it indicates a high swap usage and suggests further investigation. If the swap usage exceeds 80%, it suggests a high swap usage and recommends immediate investigation.\n\nAfter analyzing each record, the code appends the diagnostic messages for memory and swap usage to the respective variables.\n\nFinally, the code removes the last "union all" from the constructed SQL query.\n\nIn conclusion, the code analyzes the memory and swap usage of a system and generates diagnostic messages based on the specific threshold values and recent average usage. These messages provide insights into any potential memory and swap issues that may affect the system\'s performance.'}
