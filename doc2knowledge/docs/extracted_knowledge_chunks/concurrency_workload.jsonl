{'name': 'CPU_analysis_and_diagnostics', 'content': 'The code provided is analyzing the CPU workload and providing diagnostics based on certain conditions. \n\nFirst, the code retrieves CPU information using the "getcpu" function. It initializes variables "sql_cpu", "flag_cpu", and "cpuinfo". \n\nThen, it enters a loop to process each CPU resource. It concatenates SQL queries using the values from each resource, which will be used for further analysis. \n\nThe code then checks the value of the "r" attribute in each resource. If it is less than or equal to the variable "cpun" (representing the number of CPU threads), it indicates that the CPU load is not high. However, if it is greater than "cpun" but less than or equal to "cpun" multiplied by 2, it suggests that the CPU load is relatively high. If the value of "r" exceeds "cpun" multiplied by 2, it indicates a high CPU load with potential risks. The variable "flag_cpu" is incremented accordingly to keep track of the CPU load status.\n\nThe code then examines the value of the "us" attribute (representing CPU usage). If it is less than 20, it suggests that the CPU usage is not high. If it is between 20 and 80 (inclusive), it indicates normal CPU usage. If it is between 80 and 95 (inclusive), it suggests relatively high CPU usage. If the value exceeds 95 and the "r" value is greater than "cpun" multiplied by 2, it indicates a high CPU usage with a potential bottleneck. Otherwise, it concludes that the CPU is currently not experiencing performance bottlenecks.\n\nNext, the code evaluates the value of the "sys" attribute (representing system CPU usage). If it is less than 15, it suggests normal system CPU usage. If it is between 15 and 30 (inclusive), it indicates relatively high usage and requires attention to potential system issues. If it exceeds 30, it suggests significantly high system CPU usage, indicating the presence of serious vulnerabilities.\n\nBy analyzing the CPU information and applying various conditions, the code provides diagnostic information in the variable "cpuinfo". The variable "flag_cpu" keeps track of the number of identified CPU load issues.'}

{'name': 'Memory_usage_analysis_diagnosis', 'content': 'The code lines are analyzing and diagnosing the memory usage of a system. The code first retrieves the memory information using the "getmem" function. Then, it fetches the long-term memory information using the "getltmem" function with specific parameters. \n\nNext, the code initializes variables to store information about memory and swap usage. There are also flag variables that indicate whether there are any memory or swap issues.\n\nThe code then constructs a SQL query to retrieve specific memory information for each record obtained from the "getmem" function. Based on the retrieved information, the code analyzes the memory usage and assigns appropriate diagnostic messages to the "mem_info" variable. \n\nIf the physical memory usage exceeds 90% and the free memory is below 200M and above 100M, it indicates that the physical memory usage is high and the available memory is low, which may pose performance risks. Similarly, if the physical memory usage exceeds 90% and the free memory is below 100M, it suggests a high memory usage and a significant performance risk.\n\nIf the physical memory usage exceeds 20% of the recent average, it is recommended to perform further checks. \n\nThe code also checks the swap usage. If the swap usage is above 50% and below 80%, it indicates a high swap usage and suggests further investigation. If the swap usage exceeds 80%, it suggests a high swap usage and recommends immediate investigation.\n\nAfter analyzing each record, the code appends the diagnostic messages for memory and swap usage to the respective variables.\n\nFinally, the code removes the last "union all" from the constructed SQL query.\n\nIn conclusion, the code analyzes the memory and swap usage of a system and generates diagnostic messages based on the specific threshold values and recent average usage. These messages provide insights into any potential memory and swap issues that may affect the system\'s performance.'}

{'name': 'file_system_diagnostic_analysis', 'content': "The code provided is diagnosing the usage and availability of file systems. \n\nThe variable `fs` stores the file systems retrieved using the `getfs()` function. \n`fs_info` is an empty string that will be used to store diagnostic information about the file systems. \n`flag_fs` is an integer variable initialized to 0 and will be used to count the number of file systems with issues. \n\nThe code then enters a loop where it iterates over each file system in `fs`. Within the loop, the code appends SQL queries to the `sql_fs` string. These queries collect information about the file system, such as its name (`fsmp`) and percentage of disk space used (`fspct`).\n\nThe code then proceeds to analyze each file system individually. If the file system's disk usage is between 80% and 95% and the amount of free space (`fsres`) is less than 500MB, a diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` indicating that the file system's usage is high and its free space is low. The `flag_fs` variable is incremented to indicate that an issue has been detected.\n\nSimilarly, if the file system's usage is between 80% and 95% and the free space is greater than 5GB, another diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` indicating that the file system's usage is high but its free space is sufficient. `flag_fs` is incremented again in this case.\n\nIf the file system's usage is equal to or greater than 95%, a diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` indicating that the file system's usage exceeds the critical threshold.\n\nFinally, if none of the above conditions are true, which means the file system's usage is below 80%, a diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` stating that the file system's usage is normal.\n\nIn summary, this code diagnoses the usage and availability of file systems and provides relevant diagnostic information based on pre-defined thresholds. The `sql_fs` and `fs_info` variables store information for further analysis and reporting. The `flag_fs` variable keeps track of the number of file systems with issues identified."}

{'name': 'disk_group_usage_diagnostic_analysis', 'content': 'The provided code appears to be a diagnostic script related to monitoring the usage of disk groups. The code iterates over a list called \'dg\' and dynamically constructs a SQL query called \'sql_dg\' by concatenating strings. The constructed query combines the names and percentages of disk groups (\'dgname\' and \'dgpct\') using the "union all" clause.\n\nAfter constructing the SQL query, the code includes a series of conditional statements to analyze the disk group usage. If the percentage (\'dgpct\') is greater than 80 and less than 95, and the free space (\'dgfree\') is less than 2048, a diagnostic message is appended to the \'dg_info\' string indicating that the disk group usage is high and the available space is low. The \'flag_dg\' variable is incremented to indicate that a disk group exceeding the threshold has been identified.\n\nSimilarly, if the percentage is greater than 80 and less than 95, but the free space is greater than 10240, another diagnostic message is appended, indicating that the disk group usage is relatively high but the available space is sufficient. Again, \'flag_dg\' is incremented.\n\nIf the percentage is equal to or greater than 95, a diagnostic message is appended to \'dg_info\' indicating that the disk group usage is significantly exceeding the warning limit. \'flag_dg\' is incremented accordingly.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are met, a message indicating normal disk group usage is appended to \'dg_info\'.\n\nThe final line of the code trims off the trailing "union all" from the constructed SQL query.\n\nIn summary, this code analyzes the usage of disk groups and provides diagnostic messages based on defined thresholds and conditions. It iterates over a list of disk group information, constructs a SQL query, and appends diagnostic messages based on the calculated values.'}

{'name': 'session_diagnostic_analysis', 'content': 'The function retrieves session information from the database.

It also checks if the session percentage is above 90%. If it is, a diagnostic message is added to sess_info indicating that the session percentage is too high and requires attention. Additionally, the flag_sess variable is incremented. If the session percentage is below or equal to 90%, a different diagnostic message is added to sess_info indicating that the session percentage is normal.\n\nThe constructed SQL query is then truncated to remove the trailing "union all" statement.\n\nOverall, this code performs a diagnostic analysis on session information, checking for high session percentages and providing relevant diagnostic messages.'}
