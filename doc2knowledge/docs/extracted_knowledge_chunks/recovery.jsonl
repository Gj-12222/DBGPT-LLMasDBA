{'name': 'abnormal_network_status', 'content': 'This piece of code checks for abnormal network status by analyzing packet loss rate and bandwidth usage. It first checks the receive and transmit drop rates for each device and appends any abnormal rates to a list of details. It then checks the bandwidth usage for each device and appends any abnormal rates to the same list of details. If any abnormal rates are found, the function sets the detail and suggestion attributes accordingly and returns True, indicating that abnormal network status is a root cause. If no abnormal rates are found, the function returns False, indicating that abnormal network status is not a root cause. The thresholds for abnormal packet loss rate and network bandwidth usage are obtained from the monitoring module.'}
