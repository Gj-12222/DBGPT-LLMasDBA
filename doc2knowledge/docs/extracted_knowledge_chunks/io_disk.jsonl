{'name': 'io_resource_contention', 'content': 'This piece of code checks for IO resource contention in the system. It does so by iterating through the IO utils of each device and checking if the maximum IO utils exceed the disk_ioutils_threshold. If there is contention, the function provides details on the device and the IO utils that exceed the threshold. It also suggests two possible causes of contention: competing processes outside the database and long transactions within the database. If there is contention, it is considered a root cause of the issue. If there is no contention, it is not a root cause.'}

{'name': 'file_system_diagnostic_analysis', 'content': "The code provided is diagnosing the usage and availability of file systems. \n\nThe variable `fs` stores the file systems retrieved using the `getfs()` function. \n`fs_info` is an empty string that will be used to store diagnostic information about the file systems. \n`flag_fs` is an integer variable initialized to 0 and will be used to count the number of file systems with issues. \n\nThe code then enters a loop where it iterates over each file system in `fs`. Within the loop, the code appends SQL queries to the `sql_fs` string. These queries collect information about the file system, such as its name (`fsmp`) and percentage of disk space used (`fspct`).\n\nThe code then proceeds to analyze each file system individually. If the file system's disk usage is between 80% and 95% and the amount of free space (`fsres`) is less than 500MB, a diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` indicating that the file system's usage is high and its free space is low. The `flag_fs` variable is incremented to indicate that an issue has been detected.\n\nSimilarly, if the file system's usage is between 80% and 95% and the free space is greater than 5GB, another diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` indicating that the file system's usage is high but its free space is sufficient. `flag_fs` is incremented again in this case.\n\nIf the file system's usage is equal to or greater than 95%, a diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` indicating that the file system's usage exceeds the critical threshold.\n\nFinally, if none of the above conditions are true, which means the file system's usage is below 80%, a diagnostic message is added to `fs_info` stating that the file system's usage is normal.\n\nIn summary, this code diagnoses the usage and availability of file systems and provides relevant diagnostic information based on pre-defined thresholds. The `sql_fs` and `fs_info` variables store information for further analysis and reporting. The `flag_fs` variable keeps track of the number of file systems with issues identified."}

{'name': 'disk_group_usage_diagnostic_analysis', 'content': 'The provided code appears to be a diagnostic script related to monitoring the usage of disk groups. The code iterates over a list called \'dg\' and dynamically constructs a SQL query called \'sql_dg\' by concatenating strings. The constructed query combines the names and percentages of disk groups (\'dgname\' and \'dgpct\') using the "union all" clause.\n\nAfter constructing the SQL query, the code includes a series of conditional statements to analyze the disk group usage. If the percentage (\'dgpct\') is greater than 80 and less than 95, and the free space (\'dgfree\') is less than 2048, a diagnostic message is appended to the \'dg_info\' string indicating that the disk group usage is high and the available space is low. The \'flag_dg\' variable is incremented to indicate that a disk group exceeding the threshold has been identified.\n\nSimilarly, if the percentage is greater than 80 and less than 95, but the free space is greater than 10240, another diagnostic message is appended, indicating that the disk group usage is relatively high but the available space is sufficient. Again, \'flag_dg\' is incremented.\n\nIf the percentage is equal to or greater than 95, a diagnostic message is appended to \'dg_info\' indicating that the disk group usage is significantly exceeding the warning limit. \'flag_dg\' is incremented accordingly.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are met, a message indicating normal disk group usage is appended to \'dg_info\'.\n\nThe final line of the code trims off the trailing "union all" from the constructed SQL query.\n\nIn summary, this code analyzes the usage of disk groups and provides diagnostic messages based on defined thresholds and conditions. It iterates over a list of disk group information, constructs a SQL query, and appends diagnostic messages based on the calculated values.'}
